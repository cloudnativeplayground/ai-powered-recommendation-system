## How the Files Work

### Main Application
- **`Application.java`**: The entry point for the Spring Boot application. Initializes the application and its components.

### Controller
- **`RecommendationController.java`**: Exposes RESTful endpoints for managing user requests and serving personalized recommendations.

### Models
- **`UserBehavior.java`**: Represents user activity data for tracking and analysis.

### Services
- **`RecommendationService.java`**: Implements the logic for generating recommendations using the TensorFlow model.
- **`UserBehaviorService.java`**: Manages user behavior data and integrates it with the recommendation engine.

### Utilities
- **`TensorFlowUtils.java`**: Contains helper methods to load, run, and manage TensorFlow models efficiently.

### Resources
- **`application.properties`**: Configuration file for setting application properties, such as database connections and TensorFlow model paths.
- **`index.html`**: A simple static page for demonstrating the application's capabilities.

### Testing
- **`RecommendationControllerTest.java`**: Tests the REST endpoints provided by the `RecommendationController`.
- **`RecommendationServiceTest.java`**: Verifies the functionality of the `RecommendationService`.
- **`TensorFlowUtilsTest.java`**: Ensures the utility methods for TensorFlow integration work as expected.

### Build and Configuration
- **`pom.xml`**: Maven build file specifying dependencies and project configurations.
- **`config/tensorflow-model/`**: Directory to store TensorFlow model files.
- **`logs/`**: Directory to store application logs.

### Scripts
- **`start-server.bat`**: A script to start the application server locally.
- **`deploy.bat`**: A script for deploying the application to a production environment.
